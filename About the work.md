# Data-Driven-CFD
# This was done when I was a research intern at IIT Madras (CFD Laboratory, Applied Mechanics) from Dec'2018 to July'2019.
# The CNN was built to predict flow parameters for steady flow past a circular cylinder.
# Train/test data sourced through conventional laminar flow model solved in OpenFOAM.
