# Data-Driven-CFD
This work was done when I was a visiting student/research intern at IIT Madras (CFD Laboratory, Applied Mechanics) from Dec'2018 to July'2019.
The convolutional neural network was built (based on the previous work on a similar problem by Dr. Nils Thuerey at TU Munich) to predict flow parameters for steady flow past a circular cylinder. Train/test data was sourced through a conventional laminar flow model solved in OpenFOAM.

After the results from testing the model were satisfactory, the paper written was sent to INCAM (Indian national conference on applied mechanics) and upon successful review and selection, it was presented by me at the conference on 04.07.2019. The paper/project, submitted as the final thesis for my undergraduate program also obtained the best possible grade.
More details are found in the paper uploaded. Please do have a look and feel free to contact me at bprassi@gmail.com to suggest improvements!
