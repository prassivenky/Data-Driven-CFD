# Data-Driven-CFD
This work was done when I was a visiting student/research intern at IIT Madras (CFD Laboratory, Applied Mechanics) from Dec'2018 to July'2019.
The CNN was built (based on the previous work on a similar problem by Dr. Nils Thuerey at TU Munich) to predict flow parameters for steady flow past a circular cylinder.
Train/test data sourced through a conventional laminar flow model solved in OpenFOAM.
